 Letâ€™s talk about one of the data structure, which is called Binary Tree.
 Binary Tree, is one of the hierarchal data structure in which each node has at most two children .We call them as left child and right child.
 Main is the root node, others are child node.

 As an example lets calculate the number of nodes of a tree
 ## Pre-Order
 PreOrder Traversal : In simple terms, in the above tree diagram, as the name suggest, pre-order , just think about the root. For pre-order, root must be visited first, than left subtree and at last right subtree.
 Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

      public var val: Int

      public init(_ val: Int) { self.val = val; self.left = nil; self.right = nil; }
      public init(_ val: Int, _ left: TreeNode?, _ right: TreeNode?) {
          self.val = val
          self.left = left
          self.right = right
      }
  }


func preorderTraversal(_ root: TreeNode?) -> [Int] {
    guard let root else { return [] }
    return [root.val] + preorderTraversal(root.left) + preorderTraversal(root.right)
}

let root = TreeNode(1)
root.left =  TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(5)
root.left!.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left!.right = TreeNode(4)

print(preorderTraversal(root))    //Print: [1,2,3,4,5]


/*:
 We can also calculate the total number of nodes with a little modification
*/

    func countNodes(_ root: TreeNode?) -> Int {
        guard let root = root else { return 0 }
        return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right)
    }

  print(countNodes(root))  // Prints:  5
